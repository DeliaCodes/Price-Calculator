## Why Elm?

- Focus on reliability
- Focus on developer hapinnes - show error message

## Sceptic quote

`This language is too young, just a new fancy tool.`
The language itself is over 6 year old. React for reference is only 5 years old and technically younger technology then Elm.

## Reliability

Let's talk about boring stuff. How many of you care that your code works in production?
Now how many of you feel that the code you are pushing to production every day is reliable?

We have some tools to help solve those problems in JS ecosystems:

- TypeScript/Flow
- Unit/Integration Tests
- Linters

With all those tools it start to feel that we are loosing all of JavaScript fast development cycle.

Elm aims to offer a middle ground by incorporating types, linting and formatting in default tooling it eliminates the need for complicated setup.
Moreover, Elm compiler prevents you from situation where exception can occur and even with large codebases(over 200k) guarantees no runtime exceptions.
